-- Q28.1
-- Writing haversineMaybe (listing 28.4) was straightforward. Write the function
-- haversineIO without using <*>. Hereâ€™s the type signature:

-- haversineIO :: IO LatLong -> IO LatLong -> IO Double
-- haversineIO ioVal1 ioVal2 = do
--     val1 <- ioVal1
--     val2 <- ioVal2
--     let dist = haversine val1 val2
--     return dist

-- Q28.2
